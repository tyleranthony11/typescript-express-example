 * Exercise:
 * Implement a new data model and corresponding API. At the end of the day you should
 * create a model that interests you, and progresses your project in some way, but if
 * you can't think of anything, try creating a model for a collection of books which
 * may have the following properties:
 *  - ISBN
 *  - title
 *  - author
 *  - etc...
 * and lives at /api/book
 *
 * Whatever you decide be sure to implement the full set of POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE
 * operations assuming that makes sense in your case.
